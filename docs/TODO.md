# Todo

  - Work out development / deployment pipeline.
    - Figure out webpack configs, dockerfile, dev/stage/prod environments, fluently replace current homepage.
  - Create assets. Need to mimic retro assets.
    - Buildings for nav.
    - Trees for background.
    - Animated character sprite for nav.
  - Figure out color palletes. Want to use exact colors if possible.
    - Option for user to use the original button combos to select palette.
    -  The 'gameguy' console main screen could slide into view, with color options in a wheel around screen, and press option or button combo to select.
  - Build the nav
    - A 'gameguy' window should slide into view, and user should be able to move with WASD or arrows, or click on a destintion.
    - Clicking on destination will prompt the character to quickly navigate himself (A*?) to the thing.
  - Build content
