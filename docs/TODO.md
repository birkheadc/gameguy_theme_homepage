# Todo
  - Create assets. Need to mimic retro assets.
    - Buildings for nav.
    - Animated character sprite for nav.
  - Build the nav
    - A 'gameguy' window should slide into view, and user should be able to move with WASD or arrows, or click on a destintion.
    - Clicking on destination will prompt the character to quickly navigate himself (A*?) to the thing.
  - Build content
  - Somehow wait for all fonts and images to load before displaying page
  - When opening the collapsible, scroll down to it as well
  - Refactor background trees and header images to be just a greyscale image that uses the new ProcessedImage component, or at least the same functions.
