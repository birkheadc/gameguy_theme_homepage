# Todo

  - Create assets. Need to mimic retro assets.
    - Buildings for nav.
    - Animated character sprite for nav.
  - Build the nav
    - A 'gameguy' window should slide into view, and user should be able to move with WASD or arrows, or click on a destintion.
    - Clicking on destination will prompt the character to quickly navigate himself (A*?) to the thing.
  - Build content

  - Somehow wait for all fonts and images to load before displaying page

  - Figure out some way to tint or preferably post-process the images from projects api so that they fit the current theme. Dithering them as well would be a big plus.
