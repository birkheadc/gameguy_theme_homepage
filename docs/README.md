# Gameguy Theme Homepage

My latest homepage in a retro gaming theme.

## Main Focus

  - Color Theme
    - I want to theme the entire website in very simple color's, mimicking an old handheld console that shall not be named.
    - There will be a pallete-swap option to switch theme, mimicking playing a black/white game in a color console.
    - Maybe allow the user to select palette with original button combination?
    

  - Game-like nav
    - Navigation will be a pop-up window where you move the character (with WASD or arrow-keys) around a small map to navigate the site.
    - You can also just click the target area to navigate quickly
    - Aria support will also need to be done carefully.
